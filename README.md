###  What Iâ€™m working on these days :/

**Emotion Detection**  
Playing around with NLP to detect emotions from text.  

**AI Poem Generator**  
Tried making an AI poetâ€¦ letâ€™s just say it didnâ€™t rhyme with success ðŸ˜….  

**YouTube URL Scraping**  
Experimenting with Google API to scrape video URLs (does this even count as a project? ðŸ¤”).  

**Readmission Analysis**  
Predicted whether a patient would be readmitted within 30 days.  

**Excel Store Project**  
Got my hands dirty with Excel â€” data cleaning + analysis for real.
